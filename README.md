# Serverless Nodejs Project for building Scraping Rest API


What is Serverless?


    A method of providing backend services on an as-used basis
    Write and deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
    Physical servers are used but developers do not need to be aware of them
    Charges are based on usage
    Do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers
    Services auto-scale based on load
